# 🛒 Amazon Sales Data - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project presents an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the Amazon Sales dataset.  
The goal is to analyze sales patterns, understand product performance, identify profitability drivers, and generate insights.  
This project is created **purely for learning and practice purposes**, not for business application.

## **-->> 📊 Objective**

- Understand the structure of Amazon sales data.  
- Perform **data cleaning, preprocessing, and formatting**.  
- Conduct **univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis**.  
- Identify sales trends, customer behavior, and regional performance.  
- Summarize findings into business-style recommendations (for practice).

## **-->> 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used**

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
- **Data Visualization**  
- **Statistical Analysis**

## **-->> 📌 Key Steps Performed In EDA Analysis**

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Removing duplicates and irrelevant columns  
   - Data type conversion and formatting  

2. **Univariate Analysis**  
   - Distribution of sales, profit, discounts, and shipping costs  
   - Category-wise and sub-category-wise sales patterns  

3. **Bivariate Analysis**  
   - Sales vs Profit by region  
   - Category vs Discount impact  
   - Customer segment vs Revenue  

4. **Multivariate Analysis**  
   - Correlation heatmaps  
   - Profitability factors  
   - Combined influence of category, region, and discount on profit  

5. **Insights & Conclusions**  
   - Highlighted top-performing categories and regions  
   - Identified loss-making segments  
   - Suggested possible business actions

## **-->> 📌 Recommendations / Insights**

1. **Category-Wise Profitability**  
   - Technology and Office Supplies are highly profitable.  
   - Furniture segment shows frequent losses when heavy discounts are applied.  

2. **Discount Strategy**  
   - High discounts reduce profit margins drastically.  
   - Suggest limiting discounts on already low-margin products.  

3. **Regional Sales Trends**  
   - Western region shows stronger sales and profitability.  
   - Southern and Eastern regions underperform → require marketing push.  

4. **Shipping Cost Optimization**  
   - Orders with high shipping costs reduce net profitability.  
   - Partnering with logistics providers may reduce costs.  

5. **Customer Segments**  
   - Corporate segment shows higher average order value.  
   - Consumer segment drives volume but at lower margins.
